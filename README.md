# XdsKit
XdsKit is a .NET library designed to support implementers of the IHE's Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (XDS) profile.

### Why XdsKit
The primary goal of XdsKit is to provide a set of domain models that isolate a developer from IHE's mappings to ebXml and OASIS RegRep. It allows developers to focus on building higher-order services rather than the details of the messaging.
